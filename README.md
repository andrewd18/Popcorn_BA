Popcorn Battle Armor
====================

An addition to RogueTech that reduces the armor values of all battle armor to near-tabletop values, within reason.

Methodology
-----------

 * Total armor = Armor value from sheet * Number of Units * 5
 * Armor per location = Total armor divided amongst mech locations, prioritizing arms and torso before legs and head.
 * Structure approx half of armor value.
